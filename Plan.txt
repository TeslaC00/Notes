Done :-

"Notes ~~~" show be displayed in cursive on plain notes page
Close Button
Save and load note(only one note)
Multiple notes
List of notes
Save and load multiple notes
Add check to not add new note if title and description are both empty

Current :-
What to do when there is no title and only description:
	force user to give title
	generate a title based on description

Later :-
When auto-save then add new note if this note is not saved previously
When select a note from already created then adding new note creates a copy of that note (Problem)
